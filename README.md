# Board-Game-Server 

Games we will be doing:

- Battleship
- Othello
- ConnectFour

We will first tackle Connect Four first!

We need to get a generic tile game system set up.

Abstract tile class that can be used amongst all our games and future games.

Tiles must..

- Know their own location
- Know their own state/status 

Other notes:
We will not be hashing or protecting stuff.
We don't care about anything
2P game
"Sure!"
