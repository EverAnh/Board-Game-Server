So, for the balloon example, here is the way it works. 

Have some x value, call it whatever you want. In this case, I call it positionX. 
Then, have some positionY. 

As the game makes changes, make any necessary changes to positionX and positionY. 

Then, at the very end inside the while(true) loop, add something like _display.blit( ******(positionX, positionY)). In this case, replace the *'s with the name of the actual sprite/object being displayed.

I hope that this example helps.
